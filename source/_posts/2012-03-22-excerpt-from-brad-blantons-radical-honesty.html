<blockquote>
<div>Because of being lost in our own minds we fail to recognize that truth changes. When the truth changes and we fail to recognize what has now become true, while holding on to the idea of what used to be true, we become liars committing suicide. If at 8pm I am mad at you and get quite worked up over it and you get mad back, but we talk about it. And we stay committed to the conversation and to the possibility of getting over our anger, there is a good chance that by 8:45pm, we can laugh, have a drink and not be angry anymore. It was true that I hated your guts at 8pm. It was no longer true somewhere between 8:20pm and 8:45pm. In contrast, people who live according to principles like I hated you then and for good reason so I still hate you now, can't get over things.</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div>This is reasonable, but stupid. I've seen a lot of reasonably stupid people in my life. Life goes on and the truth changes. This just happens to be the way life is. What was once true is often no longer true just a little while later. Yesterday's truth is today's bullshit. Even yesterday's liberating insight is today's jail of stale explanation. Roles and rules are also thoughts which when grasped on to as principles are hard for people to get over, or get beyond, or let change. People choke the life out of themselves by tying themselves to a chosen self image, any self-image whatsoever. Many adults remain in a perpetual adolescence locked in the protective confinement of a limited set of roles and rules.</div></blockquote>
