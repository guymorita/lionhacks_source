Seeing as I've been buried in the technology world for about a year now, I thought it might be useful to write down some of my thoughts in terms of where the industry is and where I think it might be going in the near future. For many of you in the tech industry, this will pretty common knowledge. Also, most of this will be from the perspective from the US as I don't have much of a grasp of tech outside of it.

Here are a few overlying trends which I think are rapidly changing the landscape as we speak:
<ol>
	<li>Mobile - Perhaps the most rapid change is the prevalence and development rate of smartphones. This year, 2013, smartphones will surpass the desktop for web traffic. And while the desktop is still very relevant, the smartphone has interfaces and functionality that were never native to the desktop. Things like high-speed internet from anywhere, GPS, multi-touch gestures, gyroscope, accelerometer, dual cameras, audio i/o, NFC, and more. Despite the nearly 1M apps on the app store, we're still just seeing the beginning of our phones being able to use all the capabilities. Add on the fact that your phone knows more than you about what your friends are up to and where they are through a simple Facebook authentication. Like it or not, mobile is going to become the paradigm of the decade.</li>
	<li>Cloud computing - Running in parallel with our devices being on steroids is the ease of creating powerful web services to support highly scalable web and mobile apps.</li>
	<li>Internet of things</li>
	<li>Social</li>
	<li>Crowdfunding</li>
	<li>Big data</li>
</ol>
Technologies I'm excited for:

Dangers of tech:

hopefully the beginnings of the application of technology to the three largest sectors of the economy yet to be impacted by it: education, health care and public services.
