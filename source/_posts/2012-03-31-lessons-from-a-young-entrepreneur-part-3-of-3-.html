<h2>Don’t let your pride or greed get in the way</h2>
</div>
As a kid, I recall learning that pride and greed were two of the seven sins. However, this never truly resonated with me until I began to run a company. Both of them can be poisonous in the culture and actions of a company.

Pride, in its negative connotation of having an inflated sense of one’s personal status, is dangerous because it causes you to not reach out, not collaborate and not trust the judgment of those who might know better. Drop your pride to the floor and reach out to mentors for advice. Though it might feel uncomfortable, it will pay dividends later. Greed is dangerous because it is contrary to the concept of delivering value. The culture of the company should be on generating as much value for the customer as possible. Elements of greed will cause the company to be too inward looking and not focused enough on the customer. While it may lead to short-term profitability, the longer run prospects are bound to suffer. The company should only become wealthy to the extent that it helps its customers become even more wealthy.

<h2>Expectations management</h2>
</div>
I learned this idea very early on in all my dealings with clients and I’m sure it is an integral part of all businesses. Make sure that the service you deliver to clients is either equal or higher than the expectations the client has for the project. This doesn’t mean what you <em>think</em> they should expect or what is agreed upon on paper, it means what they actually expect. If there is any miscommunication or misalignment of expectations it will have an exponentially worse effect the longer it continues. This carries down to management as well. Make sure that you set the expectations of your team higher than those you set for the client.

<h2>Time management: Distractions and being Proactive vs. Reactive</h2>
</div>
As a CEO I was constantly being distracted with the concerns of my employees, clients, vendors and others. On some days I would be pinged every 5 minutes for something new. Distractions became very deadly and as I’ve learned from one study, once you’re distracted by something, it takes 20 minutes to get back to the exact train of thought you were on before getting distracted.

I put in place measures to insure that I would be able to manage my time better. I informed my team of my need to focus on one project at a time, closed my door during certain hours, turned off all IM/email notifications, minimized my taskbar, put a timer on my desk to allot 50 minute time blocks to single projects and I even removed my ALT key to stop myself from Alt-Tabing (changing windows).

The result of constantly being distracted is a reactive approach to business. If I didn’t plan a single project / task for myself, I could still fill up 12 hours/day of work from being reactive; however, being reactive did not move the company forward. Instead I had to plan my days/projects ahead of time using a proactive approach. The reactive tasks always found a way to get done.

<h2>Get mentors!</h2>
</div>
This cannot be stated enough. Don’t reinvent the wheel. Any problem you face in business and in life has probably been dealt with by someone else before. Learn from the lessons and mistakes of others. Appreciate, acknowledge and respect their time and lessons they share with you. Pay forward by mentoring others and volunteering your time and knowledge as well.

On the flip side, don’t treat your own employees like mentors. This ties back to the “Look out for yourself” lesson. Listen to your team, take their concerns/ideas seriously, but also understand their perspective. They likely don’t have the same perspective, experience and knowledge as a mentor would have.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

I hope you can learn from some of these lessons and avoid some of the mistakes I made. I would love to hear your feedback or critique. Cheers to building stronger businesses, healthier relationships, fulfilled lives and creating value for others in and outside the business world.
