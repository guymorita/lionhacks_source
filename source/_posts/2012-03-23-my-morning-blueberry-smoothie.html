<a href="http://www.lionhacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/blueberries.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-102" title="blueberries" src="http://www.lionhacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/blueberries-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>Most of you that know me, know that I've had the same breakfast for the past 9 months. I believe that a good morning and breakfast sets you off right to have a good day and week. If you put the right nutrients in your body at the start of the day, you'll feel much sharper and have smoother, consistent energy throughout the day, trust me =) Below is my original recipe and it's newest evolution, V4.0.
<h1>Original Recipe:</h1>
<h3>(actually tastes good! ask anyone that's tried it)</h3>
I blend mine in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JM2V9K/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=liohac-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B002JM2V9K">Euro-Pro Ninja Master Prep Blender and Food Processor, Blue</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=liohac-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B002JM2V9K" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> which gets the job done quickly and makes for an easy clean up. But any blender will suffice.
<ul>
	<li>One cup of frozen blueberries
<ul>
	<li>Organic preferred but obviously more expensive. In seattle, costco has a great deal of $14 for 5lbs of blueberries. Very hard to beat. In SF, the best I can find is $12 for 3lbs.</li>
	<li>Named one of the top 10 superfoods. They are packed with antioxidants and are extremely beneficial for your brain. Click <a href="http://www.womenfitness.net/blueberries.htm">here</a> for a brief list of benefits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>One banana</li>
	<li>One scoop of protein powder
<ul>
	<li>I use Syntha-6 Cookies-N'-Cream which seems to mix in well as a smoothie. I'd be very careful with the flavor you choose, chocolate probably won't bod well.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GP5HJI/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=liohac-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000GP5HJI">BSN Syntha-6 Protein Powder, Vanilla Ice Cream, 2.91 Pound</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=liohac-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000GP5HJI" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>One scoop of pro-biotic green's mix
<ul>
	<li>Improves energy and endurance, strengthens immunity, improves digestion and circulation. And there are tons of secondary benefits.</li>

</ul>
</li>
	<li>One cup of almond milk
<ul>
	<li>I use almond milk because I'm lactose intolerant. But it would probably go just as well with regular milk or soy. I use Silk's Pure Almond Original.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>One cup of filtered water</li>
	<li>Nine ice cubes
<ul>
	<li>Gives it the smoothie thickness.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h1>Morning Blueberry Smoothie V4.0:</h1>
<h3>(each new version usually tastes worse for the sake of being more healthy)</h3>
<ul>
	<li>One cup of frozen blueberries</li>
	<li>One banana</li>
	<li>One scoop of protein powder</li>
	<li>3 Tbs of ground organic flax seeds
<ul>
	<li>Flax seeds are extremely good sources of Omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, and other vitamins / minerals. For more details click <a href="http://lowcarbdiets.about.com/od/whattoeat/a/flaxinfo.htm">here</a>.</li>
	<li>Remember that you cannot digest whole flax seeds so either buy them ground, or get a coffee grinder if you buy whole ones. I mistakenly bought whole ones so I needed a coffee grinder. But it turns out to be cheaper in the long run if you ground your own. Grounded seeds are almost double the price and don't have the same shelf life.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ED7M2W/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=liohac-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000ED7M2W">Bob's Red Mill Organic Whole Flaxseed Brown, 24-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=liohac-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000ED7M2W" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>One cup of raw broccoli
<ul>
	<li>Just added this today and I have to say, even blended up it's hard to stomach. I'll see if I can adjust to it after a week and if I can't, I'll have to steam it with the hot water pitcher.</li>
	<li>Broccoli is another superfood which helps with strong bones, cancer prevention, healthy hemoglobin and iron levels and healthy sight. Raw broccoli is said to provide extra benefits to your stomach lining and digestion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>One scoop of pro-biotic green's mix</li>
	<li>One cup of almond milk</li>
	<li>One cup of filtered water</li>
</ul>
I removed the ice to help with digestion. Digesting anything cold slows down your digestion. Again, V4.0 tastes much much worse than V1.0, but it's healthier for you. And if you drink it enough, your body/taste buds will acclimate and it won't taste so bad.. hopefully.

Please let me know if you try this out and what new variations you like! I'm always testing new fruits and additions to it! Let me know what you think below! Just installed a new commenting system which makes it easy for Fb, Tw, Goog, etc. Cheers!
